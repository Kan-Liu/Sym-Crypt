Sym-Crypt is a React CRA Web App to encrypt/decrypt strings symmetrically if given the same key string.

The app is ready to use and has been deployed onto this [GitHub Page](https://kan-liu.github.io/sym-crypt/). The main encryption/decryption script ([link here](https://github.com/Kan-Liu/sym-crypt/blob/master/src/symCrypt.js)) can also be used separately.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
